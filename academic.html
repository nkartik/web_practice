			The successive academic results of JNVs in public examinations conducted by CBSE and the records about placement of students after passing out from the Vidyalayas are a clear pointer that the Samiti is moving in the right direction. The results of Class X and XII examinations of JNVs have been consistently better than the overall CBSE national averages.</p>
				<h1>Medium Of Instruction
											</h1>
	<p>	In view of the (act that most of the students admitted were taught earlier through the medium of the mother-tongue/regional language, instruction is provided through the same medium up to Class VIII during which time intensive teaching of Hindi & English both as language subjects and co-media are undertaken through skilful use of the media and modern techniques of teaching languages, so that switch over to Hindi/English after Class VII or VIII presents no difficulty. Thereafter the common medium in all Navodaya Vidyalayas is Hindi for Social Studies and English for Mathematics and Science.</p>

<h1>Three Language Formula</h1>
<p>The Scheme of Navodaya Vidyalayas provides for implementation of the Three Language Formula. The third language taught in non Hindi  speaking districts is linked with the migration of Students. In the non Hindi speaking districts, the third language taught in a Navodaya Vidyalaya is the language of the 30% students migrating to that Vidyalaya from Hindi regions. This language is compulsory for all. In the Hindi regions, Navodaya Vidyalayas follow the normal Three Language Formula i.e. regional language, Hindi and English. In our school "Hindi" is the third language.</p>

<h1>Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation</h1>
<p>Education is a unique investment and accountability is possible only through a well planned mechanism of assessment with reference to its objectives. Examination in 'its traditional sense has failed to achieve the objectives of education. Introduction of the Scheme of Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation is, therefore, the only alternative to de-emphasis the system of external examinations. The Scheme has been introduced effectively in all the JNVs since 1989-90 with the following objectives:

		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To make evaluation an integral part of teaching learning process.</li>
			<li>To use evaluation for improvement of students achievement and teaching learning strategies on the basis of regular diagnosis followed by remedial instructions.</li>
			<li>To make a sound judgment and to plan timely strategies on the basis of regular diagnosis followed by the remedial instructions.</li>
			<li>To maintain desired standard for performance using evaluation as a quality control device.</li>
			<li>To facilitate sound judgment and to take timely decisions about the learner, learning process and the learning environment.</li>
			<li>To provide scope for self-evaluation by teachers and students. Special training has been provided to the Principals and teachers to ensure maintenance of CCE records in proper order.</li>
